# CF Internal Tools

Staff-facing internal tools for Cornerstone Fellowship. One repo, one deployed
site, one login. Each tool is a folder under `tools/`.

## Live tools

| Path | Tool | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `/tools/staff-hub/` | Staff Hub | Pilot, in progress |
| `/tools/facilities/` | Facilities request | Planned |
| `/tools/it/` | IT request | Planned |
| `/tools/comms/` | Comms request | Planned |

  migrations/      Numbered .sql, applied through the Supabase MCP connector
  policies/        RLS policy definitions, one file per table
docs/              Architecture, auth decision, conventions, deploy
```

## Two folders, on purpose

Code lives here, outside OneDrive. Git and OneDrive sync fight each other and
corrupt `.git`.

Documents, decisions, source Excel workbooks and reference material live in
OneDrive:

`CF Work Files/11_CLAUDE-Workspace/CF Internal Tools/`

Build scripts read workbooks from that OneDrive path and write JSON into
`tools/<tool>/data/` here. The generated JSON is committed. The workbooks are
not.

## Before anything goes live

Auth is unresolved. See `docs/auth.md`. Nothing with real staff data ships
until that decision is made.

## Publishing

Claude edits files and leaves them uncommitted. Ryan reviews the diff in
GitHub Desktop and pushes. Database changes go directly through the Supabase
MCP connector.
